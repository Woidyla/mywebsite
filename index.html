        <center><p>Welcome to my personal website! Here, you can learn a little bit about me, my goals and my achievements. 
          Here, you will be able to learn more about me, my goals, achievements and skillset. For now, all other pages are "Work in Progress".</p></center>
      <br>
      <center><p>I was born and raised in California and moved when I was 22, out to Las Vegas NV.
			I lived there for almost 8 years and was not a fan of the weather! In 2019 I joined the
			Amazon community, starting at LAS7. In 2021 I moved out to North Carolina and started at
			GSO1 as a Process Assistant. I transfered to RDU9 at launch, as a Ship Clerk for Logistics department.
			I have been with RDU9 for almost 2 years and have trained most of the team including the AMs and some OMs
			for dispatch side. <br><br></center>

  		<center>	Currently I am working towards a carreer in IT, specificlly Software Development side. This is my reasoning for joining
			Correlation One with their Software and Web Development course to achive my certificate. I am simultaniously working on 
			my Six Sigma to better extend my knowledge and skill set for process improvement, management and so on.<br><br></p></center>

    <p><center>I am making this website about me for a project within C1 courses. So far I have learned Basic and Intermediate HTML, which includes understanding of tags, methods, headings, images, links, etc. So far I have enjoyed learning the different elements. Right now I have 
  basic knowledge of Javascript, CSS and a few others but I'm looking forward to learning much more in the future, including the many different markup/coding languages.</center></p>
